> [!IMPORTANT]
> `vite-plugin-web-extension` will soon be deprecated in favor of [WXT](https://wxt.dev), it's successor. While WXT is still in pre-release, it already supports everything this plugin does, [is significantly more popular](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=wxt-dev/wxt,aklinker1/vite-plugin-web-extension&type=Date), and includes more features and bug fixes that aren't (and won't) be added to `vite-plugin-web-extension`.
>
> If you're starting a new project, I'd recommend you [use WXT instead](https://wxt.dev/guide/installation.html#bootstrap-project). Once WXT v1.0 is released within the next few months, [I'll provide a more in-depth migration guide](https://wxt.dev/guide/resources/migrate.html#vite-plugin-web-extension) for existing projects and `vite-plugin-web-extension` will enter maintainence mode.
