# Upgrading to v3

The transition from v2 to v3 primarily involves the update to Vite 4.

To upgrade, you simply need to install the latest version of Vite:

```sh
pnpm i vite@latest
```

Please note that you will also need to update any other Vite plugins you're using to their respective versions that are compatible with Vite 4.

> For users migrating from v1, it is important to first follow the steps outlined in the [v2 migration guide](https://v2.vite-plugin-web-extension.aklinker1.io/guide/migration-v2.html).
