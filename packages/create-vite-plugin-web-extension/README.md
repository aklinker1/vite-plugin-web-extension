# Starter Kit

This package contains a starter kit for bootstrapping a new project with `vite-plugin-web-extension`.

```bash
npm create vite-plugin-web-extension
pnpm create vite-plugin-web-extension
yarn create vite-plugin-web-extension
```

## Development

When making changes to this package, you can run the starter kit via the `start` script. You'll likely want to run it against your fork, like so:

```bash
pnpm start --repo <your-https-remote-url> --branch <your-branch-name>
```

If you're not working off a fork (basically just for maintainers with direct access to the repo), you can use:

```bash
pnpm start --branch <your-branch-name>
```

### Adding/Fixing Templates

You do not need to publish an update the the NPM package to add or fix templates. Templates are consumed by the create command by cloning the `main` branch of the repo - so changes just need to be merged into `main`!

Here's the steps the starter kit follows to create a project using a template:

1. Clone the repo
2. Get a list of templates from the `templates/templates.json` file via the raw github URL
3. Copy `templates/shared` folder into the project folder
4. Copy the `templates/<template-name>` folder into the project folder (overwriting any files from the shared folder)

To add a new template, add a new folder inside `templates` directory named after the template name, and add files for that template inside it.

> All templates should result in a similar extension, see the other templates for an example.

## Deployment

When making change to the `indext.ts` or `src` directory, a deployment is required.

To deploy, use the "Publish Starter Kit" action on GitHub. It will verify all the templates build successfully, bump the version, then deploy the package to NPM.

Changelogs are not published to Github releases. Instead, look at the [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) file in this directory.
